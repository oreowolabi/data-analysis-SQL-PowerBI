# data-analysis-SQL-PowerBI
Projects combining SQL and Power BI for visualization

This project basically looks through Hotel Revenue data from Absent Data, found here: https://www.absentdata.com/hotel_revenue_historical_full/.
The goal of the process is to answer three questions:
1. Is hotel revenue growing by year?
2. Should we increase parking lot size?
3. What trends can we see in the data.

SQL was used to prepare the data, while Power BI was used to obtain answers to these questions.

Below is how the dashboard came out:
